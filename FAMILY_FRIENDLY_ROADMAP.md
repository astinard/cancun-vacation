## What We're NOT Doing (To Keep It Simple)

| Feature | Why We're Skipping It |
|---------|----------------------|
| Complex price tracking | We'll book in Feb, prices won't matter after |
| Daily deal alerts | Too many notifications = annoyed family |
| Detailed budget splitting | Handle money in person, not apps |
| Photo sharing on site | Use regular group chat instead |
| Real-time location sharing | Too invasive, not needed |

---

## Communication Schedule

| When | What | How |
|------|------|-----|
| Jan 5 | "Vote for your resort!" | Group text + link |
| Jan 15 | "Here's our resort!" | Group text + photo |
| Feb 1 | "Book your flights by Feb 15" | Group text |
| Feb 15 | "Share your flight confirmations" | Group text |
| Apr 1 | "Vote on excursions!" | Group text + link |
| May 15 | "Final details + packing list" | Group text |
| May 24 | "SEE YOU IN CANCUN!" | Group text |

---

## The Golden Rules

1. **Max 1 action item per month** for family members
2. **No apps to download** - everything works in browser
3. **No accounts to create** - just click and vote
4. **No money talk in the group** - handle privately
5. **Keep emails/texts SHORT** - bullet points only

---

## Success =

- Everyone had fun
- Nobody felt stressed by planning
- We stayed within budget
- Kids had a blast
- Grandparents were comfortable
- We want to do it again!

*Remember: The goal is the vacation, not the planning tool.*
